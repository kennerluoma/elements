          The beginning of the 20th century was a big turning point for design. This marked the beginning of very important design philosophies era of Modern Art. I would argue this time period is the most influential design period on modern web design. There were
          a lot of “firsts” during the first half of the 20th century that have been copied repeatedly over and over and expanded upon.

        <p class="paragraph">Printed media was used for advertisements, with designers using very minimal layouts combined with just the right amount of content to pique interests. Of the early 20th century schools of thought, the Bauhaus’s teachings were among the most important.
          The world of web design started out very rough and basic in the 1990s. It took a while for technology and designers to collide to allow for better design and layout.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The World Wide Web was born in the 90s, and the first websites were purely text with no layout methods. Later on the best layout methods were simple hacks of the table tag. CSS would be introduced soon after, and the current CSS3 released The first half
          the Web’s life was filled with designs with no style influences whatsoever, or very complex sites with so much content you don’t know where to start. Websites in the 2000s such as Yahoo, MySpace, and AOL tried to display all of their information and
          links in one screen.

        <p class="paragraph">
          These website’s did not embrace minimalism or the Bauhaus, but the structure of the layouts were very newspaper feeling. The newspaper layouts could have some influence of De Stijl and constructivism pieces, although still do not embrace the feeling behind
          those movements. Flash was the best technology to make more creative websites, however there were many security issues with flash, and it would not end up being the future of web design.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          It wouldn’t be until the late 2000s that websites opted for a more user friendly approach to their designs. These designs are heavily influenced by design movements from the 20th century, and newer specifications from the World Wide Web Consortium, or
          W3C, allowed for designs that could equal or best printed designs. With the growth of the web and need for mobile device solutions, many popular responsive frameworks were developed. The leading framework, Bootstrap, is an easy solution to the problem,
          but the popularity of it led to a very standardized looking web. While this is great for users and navigating websites, everything started to feel too cookie cutter.

        <p class="paragraph">
          The Bootstrap approach to web design uses familiar components to be recycled in similar layouts, but with modified in shapes, sizes, and colors. The solution Bootstrap presented was inspired by the Bauhaus. User experience on a Bootstrap website would
          be the same no matter the topic. The built in mobile resizing features the popular hamburger menu, and while controversial for usability itself, managed to stay the most popular way to display a menu on a website. After many years of the hamburger
          menu, the general public has learned what the horizontal bars represent: the menu. In my opinion standardization is a great thing, but the popularity of Bootstrap caused a lack of new design, and I think is overused. The hamburger menu isn’t the best
          user experience, but for minimalism it is great.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          I see the most influence from the time between WWI and WWII for modern web design. Very boxy and rectangular websites and even operating systems, e.g. Windows 10, are trendy now. The layouts look like they are a modern version of a De Stijl piece.

      <section class="container">
        <p class="paragraph">Also trending in the 2010s are large “hero” sections of websites, the large banner section at the top of websites. The hero section is equivalent to a poster or cover page. Posters from the constructivism movement have layouts that are
          also seen in web design. Large title text with a fullsize image covering the entire width or height of the available space.

        <p class="paragraph">
          UX (user experience) is a very big part of web designs. The idea of how a user will navigate a website, and easy it is to locate the necessary information, and how engaging websites are are the main goals of a UX designer. We also have to consider accessibility
          for users. These goals reflect the Bauhaus’s intentions with their minimalist designs.

          The designs are easiest to use when there is only the necessary information presented. To help with the experience, many many icons have been created. The best icons are obvious in their meaning, others fall short and without text assisting in their interpretation
          can easily be misunderstood. Icons existed long before the internet, and the internet only amplified their usage, even leading to the emoji emergence.

          A major component of web design is the typeface. Some of the most popular fonts used on the web were made in the first half of the 20th century. Everyone recognizes Times New Roman, a font that was made in 1932. Helvetica is also a very popular font that
          was made before the web in 1957. These old typefaces have never looked better than on the newest high resolution displays available on devices these days. The early web relied on fonts that were easy to read when heavily pixelated.

          Now there are two newer display methods in CSS3 that allow for more complex layouts without the need for various “hacks” that frameworks like Bootstrap relied on. However, since these are not supported on older browsers, frameworks and previous hacks
          to layout pages are still required for the foreseeable future for larger businesses. Some of the brilliant designs of the past century are now very possible to mimic on a website.

        <p class="paragraph">
          Art Movements before and after the Modern era have more specific influences on websites. Some fashion, luxury, and wedding websites opt for a design that could be considered Art Nouveau or Art Deco. Other websites targeted at younger people--clothing
          brands, artists, or other entertainment--can have more of a post modern feel to them. Even with these other art styles, the foundation for websites almost always have layouts established or influenced by the great art movements of the 20th century.
